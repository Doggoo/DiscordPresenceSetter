# DiscordPresenceSetter

This was created by General Wrex on November 26th, 2017, if you create your own from the source, discord.rpc is not mine, its from https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc

if you use anything in your own program besides the wrapper or discord-rpc, please credit me ;)





Create a NON BOT app, setup rich presence, run the program.. and it should set the details to your discord name

Using: https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc
