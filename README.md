# DiscordPresenceSetter

This was created by General Wrex on November 26th, 2017, if you create your own from the source, discord.rpc is not mine, its from https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc

if you use anything in your own program besides the wrapper or discord-rpc, please credit me ;)


It doesn't contain the code for accepting an invite yet, but it will set your rich presence on discord!


Create a NON BOT app (Don't try to set ADVANCED RICH PRESENCE FEATURES, unless you're actually creating a game or application that you want approved by discord), setup rich presence, fill out the details on the app, you'll need the clientid from the discord developer page, run the program.. and it should set the details to your discord name!

This was designed as a test to see if it was possible to create an app to set the presence of a user, it was released on Github because i like showing all of my programming stuff that's not under a NDA!

Using: https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc
