# DiscordPresenceSetter (DPS)

This was created by General Wrex on November 26th, 2017, if you create your own from the source, discord-rpc is not mine, its from https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc, You'll need the **discord-rpc.dll** from the zip contained in the release on the releases page as I wont include it in the the source

if you use anything in your own program besides the wrapper or discord-rpc, please credit me ;)

It wont do anything other than showing a Presence to other users!

Check the [How To Create An App Readme](https://github.com/generalwrex/DiscordPresenceSetter/blob/master/CreateApp.md) on how to create an application for DPS to use.
